# NLP Classifier as an API

Readme must be written.

Notes: python3.9/3.10 can get pandas==1.4.0 but python3.7 can get to 1.3.5 max so when trying a venv with py37 (previous: 3.9+) I changed reqfile from `pandas=1.4.0` to `pandas>=1.3.5`.

It seems to work (py3.7)

[And also removed jupyter at that.]
