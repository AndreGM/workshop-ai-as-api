# TODO

README: screenshots of the training phase

README: we/you, set this uniform (you)

refactor non-route functions out of main.py

comments in routes (also for doc)

gitpod yaml: two shells

a progressive buildup of CURLs

last is the calls log and then I call from my machine and call the call log

mention if db hibernated, "urllib.error.HTTPError: HTTP Error 503: Service Unavailable"

a flag to fake the classifier (with a replacement faker class), for when the training fails but one wants to play with the API
